# php-work-days
A tool to get the working days in a time period, how many have passed, and how many remain.

!!! IMPORTANT !!!
The days passed and remaining only work if the month and year you pass in are the current month.  The project I initially built this for was calling this function using $currentMonth and $currentYear variables.  It would be easy enough to extend the function to have a day passed in as well, and I will likely eventually do so.

Jumping back into github.  Made this edit to follow the tutorial.  Hoping this simple tool will help others!
